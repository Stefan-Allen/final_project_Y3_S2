                        Pollution, like a shadowy specter, threatens to engulf the world in darkness. Foul emissions
                        from
                        factories, the toxic potions brewed by dark sorcerers, and the vile waste dumped into rivers by
                        greedy trolls - these are but a few of the weapons wielded by the forces of pollution. The time
                        has
